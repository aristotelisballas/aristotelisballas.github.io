We recently submitted our latest research paper named "On the Out-Of-Distribution Robustness of Self-Supervised Representation Learning for 
Phonocardiogram Signals" for review. You can take a look at the [preprint manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00502) on ArXiv and the open-source 
[codebase](https://github.com/aristotelisballas/listen2yourheart/) on GitHub.

This one was a nerve-racking, nail-bitting, Star Wars-inspired and zero-stress (jk) wonder of a project.
Along with [Christos Diou](https://diou.github.io) and [Angelos Charalambidis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acharal/), we 
setup and configured an on-premise High Performance GPU Cluster for HUA.

HUA's HPC cluster utlizes the [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) resource management and
task scheduling system for managing the departmental GPU cluster. The GPU cluster is a pool
of NVIDIA GPUs for CUDA-optimized deep/machine learning frameworks such as
PyTorch and Tensorflow.

Below you may find a list of all the teaching activities I have been involved with.

### Data Management II
> Along with C.Diou, we introduced students to the world of Machine 
Learning as a part of this course. Specifically, this course 
provides an introduction to basic concepts and definitions related 
to ML, such as data preparation Ordinary and Multiple Linear 
Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Ensemble
methods, Fully Connected Neural Networks and CNNs. In addition,
students are introduced to well-known ML libraries, e.g.
Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow.
The course is included in the HUA [Applied Informatics](https://applied.dit.hua.gr/en/home/) Postgraduate program.

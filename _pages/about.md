Welcome to my personal wannabe website. I am Aristotelis, an aspiring PhD student researching Algorithms for Robust Representation Learning at
[HUA](https://www.dit.hua.gr/index.php/en/), under the supervision 
of Prof. [Christos Diou](https://diou.github.io). Just so you who you should either blaim or praise. 

Currently, I'm really interested in [Domain Generalization](https://hua-aiml.github.io/dgtutorial/) and AI in healthcare. I'm also
involved with some other things, which hopefully you can find 
throughout the website.

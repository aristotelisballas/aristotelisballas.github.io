Welcome to my personal wannabe website. I am Aristotelis, an aspiring PhD student researching Algorithms for Robust Representation Learning at the
[Harokopio University of Athens](https://www.dit.hua.gr/index.php/en/), under the supervision 
of Prof. [Christos Diou](https://diou.github.io). I also hold a diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Tecnical University of Athens. 

Currently, I'm really interested in [Domain Generalization](https://hua-aiml.github.io/dgtutorial/) and AI in healthcare. Besides working towards my [PhD](publications), I'm also involved with some other [things](/projects), which you can hopefully find throughout the website.
